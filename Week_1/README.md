# Category Theory Preliminaries 
A lecture/talk given by Tora Ozawa on some basic category theory. Talk was open to undergaduates as well who had seen at least basic definitions in abstract algebra. 

### Material Covered
Definition of a category/morphisms, ismorphisms, (finite) diagrams, functors, universal properties and objects, (co)limits.

### Key Concepts Covered
Categories as contexts, Categories need not be "sets with some structure"
Functors are "mathematical constructions"/"transformations", functors generalize (finite diagrams)
These abstract definitions encapsulate lots of mathematical phenomena. 
topologies: abstract version of euclidean space

### Key Examples 
Categories: groups, rings, topological spaces, one object groupoid, natural numbers (in a few senses), "Category of Categories"
Functors: fundamental group, "sheaf of continuous real valued functions" (without using the word sheaf), diagrams, group/ring homomorphisms, continous maps
